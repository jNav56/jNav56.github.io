# Blog 1: 08/30/2020

This is the first blog I am writing as a student for CS371P in Professor Glenn Downing's class. I am excited to see what happens in the course and I hope for great things.

## Where did you grow up?

I grew up in Houston, Texas near downtown. To be more specific I spent most of my time in the northside of this city doing things in the Heights area and in Humble where Deerbrook is at. I love this city and all the people who reside in it. Although the driving here is scary because not many people use their blinkers, it's fun to explore (not sure if the lack of blinking is more common in the region, state, or even nation). Side note, growing up here I always thought that the size of Houston was very common. However, learned that was not the case and I have felt the difference living in Austin. Anyways, I grew up in Houston, Texas and it's a nice place to live in. 

## What was your favorite extracurricular activity in high school?

I would say it is band, but more specifically jazz band was fun. It had less to do with the music we played in the class but more about the times we spent going to festivals and other events where the school was asked to help out in. I think the size of the people in jazz band was a number where there was a lot of people, but it wasn't huge. So a lot of us interacted with each other a lot more. Plus, listening to other people at festivals was always a treat.

## What are your expectations of this class?

From what I heard from a lot past students it is all about C++ and learning about the language. At the same time I'm just going in thinking C++ will be used to show object-oriented concepts like Java was used in CS312 and CS314
