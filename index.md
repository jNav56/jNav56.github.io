## How well do you think the course conveyed those takeaways?

### test first, test during, test after, test, test, test
### when designing algorithms, demand the weakest iterators (e.g. bidirectional vs. random access)
### when designing containers, provide the strongest iterators (e.g. random access vs bidirectional)
### build adapters on top of containers, iterators, and functions
### always look for reuse and symmetry in your code
### collaboration is essential to the quality of your code and to your well-being in producing it
### refactor, refactor, refactor
### make your code beautiful

I think the course did well in conveying these concepts. Particularly in always looking to reusing code throughout classes, I think the course showed a good deal of examples of how this can be applied when writing code no matter the level detail. Honestly, the examples were probably the most useful parts of the class since Professor Downing was clear in their explanations and had a nice flow of going through the examples.

## Were there any other particular takaways for you?

I would say the use of Gitlab was a very nice takeaway, it was a nice introduction to a tool that I have seen a lot of people use. If not specifically Gitlab, this class definitely gave students a taste of using branches, merges, pull, and push mechanics that are seen in many computer science fields.

## How did you feel about two-stage quizzes and tests?

The two-stage quizzes was very nice I thought. There were times that I passed the first time and it seemed redundant to go to the second stage with the group. However, it goes without saying that I was very glad to have gone to the second stage because there were times I did mess the first time.

## How did you feel about cold calling?

Kept me paying attention in class and gave me incentive to know what was going on in the lectures that came before.

## How did you feel about office hours?

I thought office hours were good, the TAs really knew what they were doing and Professor Downing was extremely helpful and nice about you learning the material. There was a feeling of acceptance and good intentions prevalent in the office hours, so I really appreciated that.

## How did you feel about lab sessions?

Unfortunately I was not able to go to the lab sessions, but I did have friends who did go and they always seemed to have a better understanding of the projects and that in turn made it easier on me. Althoug it doesn't surprise me because the instructors were always helpful.

## Give me your suggestions for improving the course.

If I had to give one suggestion I think it would be good have more Hackerrank exercises in the class lectures. I know we had a few throughout the semester, but some of them were long and I thought that having some smaller ones that could be done under 5 minutes would be good. If anything a Hackerrank exercises done with the whole class and teacher would also be nice.

## What did you do this past week?

The first half I was finishing up some work for two of my classes that aren't related to my major. That was fun. Afterwards, I studies for test that I had this past Thursday which I feel pretty good about. More so that it's done and I have less major assignments to prepare for now. Finally I started and luckily finished the Darwin project.

## What's in your way?

Just a lot of things that were overlapping each other made it a very difficult time to manage my responsibilities, but we are past it and I will watch a movie to wind down. Other than that, things went smoothly in other departments so I cannot complain there.

## What will you do next week?

I have two big projects and hefty paper on a book I am reading at the moment due by the middle of November. It's safe to say that most of my attention will be put into getting those obligations out of the way.

## If you read it, what did you think of The Interface Segregation Principle?

I liked it. I know I have heard about it from other people and teachers which is nice, but it did feel good to read the concept and actually put a name to it instead of describing it to myself when I think of it.

## What was your experience of continuing to implement std::vector?

I have not had any experience with implementing vector before but it's pretty cool to get a layout of what goes into creating a class that's formal. Formal in the way that is pretty well built and very versatile. I feel if I made the class without some of the details we went over in class it would have taken up a lot of space and time for methods to work.

## What made you happy this week?

Halloween was actually pretty fun (I did not go to a party, we like to be safe around here) because I actually carved decent looking pumpkin of Perry the Platypus in my opinion. I made popcorn with some spices and it tasted alright. I also took pictures with my dog dressed as a taco and me as a bottle of hot sauce.

## What's your tip-of-the-week?

If you have time I would recommend a book called *The Pragmatic Programmer* by Andrew Hunt and David Thomas. It's just a book that so far has talked about great practices anyone can follow to drill in their heads that does help with learning some concepts. It talks about things that I have heard about before, but it's been interesting how the book has worded it's explanations. If you, can I like it so far.

## What did you do this past week?

I studied for the test of this class for the better first half of the week. Afterwards, I just did other coursework. Also the course schedule came out and I wanted to look at that (planning the course schedule can be time consuming on it's own because you get curious). Finally I tried to plan some graduation mini-events, since I don't think Covid will be gone or something to sneeze at in June, for my friend and I. I want to make a stage and print out a big banner and have a virtual celebration with a large circle of friends and family. 

## What's in your way?

Right now I can say that I am ahead enough where I have some down time that I want to use on my personal projects and into the future projects I have coming up. Only time will tell. 

## What will you do next week?

A lot of reading and drawing that I have to do, some due dates are coming along and creeping up and there is still some details I have to polish in my work. Other than that I want to do some deep cleaning of my room and organize it differently.

## If you read it, what did you think of The Liskov Substitution Principle?

I liked it, I do enjoy the readability of most of these articles and that's always a plus. But either way, it made sense and it did seem to provide helpful guidelines to follow in the industry. The examples they use are nice too, just fast and simple.

## What was your experience of Test #1?

The first day definitely had a tough question, but I felt ok with the rest of the questions after that. The next day did feel bittersweet and that is mainly coming from the fact you sometimes overthink some things, but what can you do at that point.

## What made you happy this week?

Well the Astros did play very well and they got out of a 3-0 hole they were put in. Even though they lost it was still a good game.

## What's your tip-of-the-week?

Move on with life, there are some stuff you can't change or control so just hope for the best. I know the slang "nimodo" is definitely used in Mexican culture, but that's what the feeling should be.

# Blog 7: 10/11/2020

## What did you do this past week?

I worked on a project for one of my other classes that I had started the week before. It was really fun and definitely took all my creative energy out. Afterwards I caught up on notes for every class, especially this one since we have a test coming up. I also started to read a book assigned to me about disablities in comic writing. It's very interesting so far and made me think about stuff I didn't before. Finally on Wednesday I began working on the allocator project. For some reason I thought it was due next week and I didn't realize the mistake in my calendar. Regardless of that I am almost done with the everything, I just need to make the ctd file and I should be good to turn it in.

## What's in your way?

The pile of work is in my way, I don't know if that's a sufficient answer. But after someone gets a certain amount of work that and then exceeds that amount their brain shuts down and takes a well 'deserved' break. That's the feeling I had all week that made it even harder to get work done.

## What will you do next week?

Study for the upcoming test and hopefully get more things done in advanced. It really surprises me how others seem to have a lot of time to do other things for their career prospects and clubs. I'm not saying it's bad, it's more like I want to be at that level where I am good enough to make time like they have been able to do.

## If you read it, what did you think of The Open-Closed Principle?

It was a bit confusing. It seemed to knock down a lot of ideas that I have been thought in the past. I just took the moment as old tools used for future students and moved on. Hopefully whatever job I get has practices I can easily get acquainted with.

## What was your experience of iterator concepts, std::array, and std::vector?

The iterator and standard array concepts were very cool and I think knowing how pointers worked really helped. I did get a little lost when Professor Downign was explaining the the methods that were called when user-defined classes gave an iterator.

## What made you happy this week?

First and foremost I am very happy to see the Houston Astros win and go to the next level below the World Series, I thought it was a great game and I am happy the team won when a lot of other fans were talking in vain against them. Other than that I am very happy to know that I have more time on the project so working should be a lot easier next week and I shouldn't have as much stress as I had this week. 

## What's your pick-of-the-week?

This isn't exactly software related, but if you ever wondered if your doctor has taken money from a drug company there is a website called Dollar for Docs that has a database of doctors in the US and how much money they have taken to promote a drug from a company to their patients.

# Blog 6: 10/04/2020

## What did you do this past week?

I studied for a test that I had on Tuesday. Felt ok about that, but like with a lot of things I was a little nervous since I didn't know what to expect. After I took my test I spent the rest of the week taking notes for other classes and finishing up assignments that were due this past Friday. Finally for the weekend I dedicated time on catching my notes up for this class.

## What's in your way?

Nothing was in my way from what I could tell. Everything seemed fine and I was able to manage my time well this past week.

## What will you do next week?

I will start on a personal project that I've had in mind to get me better adjusted to using front-end tools. Also, I want to start on project 3 and prepping for the test. For classes aside from this I only have to read a few chapters from a book and take light notes.

## If you read it, what did you think of Why Is Silicon Valley So Awful to Women?

Unfortunately I feel like some of us know what it's like to be treated as a burden in society due to what we look like or where we come from, and I can at least know being a woman (or even a woman of color from low income communities at that) is not any easier. I think it's good to show this to students, it at least tries to give us the ideas of how to be better.

## What was your experience of arrays, equal(), and iterators?

The array lesson towards the end did confuse me a bit, but I get that's the effect Professor Downing wanted since it supported the argument to not use arrays. I have worked with the equals method before and I have been told in the past to override it. However I have yet to implement it with templates, which was new to me but very eye-catching. Lastly, I think I was more familiar with the iterators and the concepts learned in class.

## What made you happy this week?

First and foremost being done with the test was relieving, it wasn't as hard as I thought and I know what to expect for next time.

## What's your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?

My tip of the week is to read. And I get it, reading is hard and I'm a slow reader. I will say that reading 10 minutes a day or 10 pages a day is very helpful. You get some time to read even when you are extremely busy and when the habit becomes second nature your reading speed increases.

# Blog 5: 09/27/2020

## What did you do this past week?

I mainly worked on the voting project since I did a lot of work from other classes the weekend before. Thankfully I was able to finish the hackerrank portion of the project earlier than anticipated and able to focus on the logistical portion where we had to create the makefile, the ctd, and other files to make the pipeline work.

## What's in your way?

Daily responsibilities in the household were heavy this week also, living in Austin away from my hometown had its fairshare of events that took me away from doing school work like a job that I needed or helping out my friend who I couldn't leave at the doorstep. But being in Houston just gives me more domestic chores that I have to do, I'm not gonna tell my mom no. With this I help my mom around with her job to bring in more income when times are specifically tough.

## What will you do next week?

The same thing I am doing during this weekend and that is preparing to study for my test in CS 331. The notes and slides that we have looked at so far does not have the most heavy subjects, but like with most math tests we use simple concepts to solve complicated problems. Afterwards I want to spend the latter half of the week taking notes and finishing assignments for my other non-cs classes. Then I will start to study for the test for this class.

## What was your experience of values, addresses, references and consts?

I had a basic understanding of pointers and using the variable to access and change data from CS 429 and CS 439, but the use of the const keyword with pointers was new to me. But during class just listening to descriptions of the declarations with pointers like "pointers that only point to one address" did help in better understanding the lessons from the week.

## What made you happy this week?

Just being able to finish work was enough for me, but I do want to focus more on getting a full time job for when I graduate this Spring.

## What's your tip-of-the-week?

If you have time and the resources, try to learn how to cook. Food always tastes better when you make it yourself.

# Blog 4: 09/20/2020

## **What did you do this past week?**

I was working on assignments from other classes. From that bunch homework 2 from CS 331 (Algorithms and Complexities) with Professor Gal had a problem where he had to describe the Towers of Hanoi and that burned me out. Other than school, I played games and tried to review my resume to hopefully get some kind of internship or job lined up for the summer and beyond. However at this point there is still time to play catch up on some classes that I had to miss since I was needed in Austin for a friend's dentist appointment.

## **What's in your way?**

Time and location. I am starting to get to the point where I wish I had more time and that's only because I have been slacking off a bit in my responsibilities. I do want to preface by saying that the situation of staying in my house and room for a long period of time is draining that definitely makes me more sluggish. On one hand there are people who say that should be very strict in where you work, rest, and eat within in your home, but that in itself requires tremendous discipline that I will admit I do not have.

## **What will you do next week?**

The coming week is going to be given up to taking notes for a class on marketing, studying for my test in math, reading a book for an information studies class, and of course the voting project. I think the challenge I will have with this project is going to be with the started code and the other files I will have to build which were given to us in project 1. Still, getting through will be a good learning experience.

## **What was your experience of exceptions, voting, and strcmp?**

My experience with exceptions was just a simple try-catch implementation of one exception being thrown. I had no real clue about the implications involving more than one exception and the relationships exceptions could have with one another. My experience with voting... I will assume that you are talking about the coding aspect from class. To that I have no experience with it, but I was excited to see the implementation that Professor Downing explained this past friday. If we are talking about actual voting, I voted once on the national level and it did not end well. Now if we are talking about strcmp, I think I had a project in the computer architecture class that had us implementing a few of the typical string methods with C.

## **What made you happy this week?**

Getting a new chest freezer, we had an old freeze in the house for all the meat and fish we'd keep for later use. As things get older there is wear and tear, so getting a new chest took off a big check from the to-do list.

## **What's your tip-of-the-week?**

Respect people's boundaries and their space, it's always easier to mind your own business. This isn't meant to be mean, of course we all want to talk to other people or form relationships. But if they show signs that might most likely say they don't want an interaction, then it's better fro everyone to stop pursuing. It's ok if you have good intentions, but if the other person does not feel the same way simply telling them your intentions is not enouhg. Don't let one event discourage you though.

# Blog 3: 09/13/2020

## **What did you do this past week?**

This week for the class, I worked on Collatz for most the time starting on Tuesday and finishing up on in the early hours of Friday. I did most of my work from other classes the weekend before so I was able to set a lot of time for the Collatz project. Now, outside of the class I tried to make a garden bed from the wood my dad brought from his job. We had some pumpkin seeds so I planted that after I was done. Also, I was checking my Twitter and someone from high school messaged me asking if I wanted to go into forex (foreign exchange) trading which was funny.

## **What's in your way?**

Well last week, me not having any experience with git was an issue. Thankfully I was able to get a handle of things and the workflow made more sense. However, this week the actual implementation of Collatz was an issue on one part. I didn't have much difficulty implementing most of the optimizations we learned in class. However there was one technique that I had problems using efficiently so I skipped on it only to later be able to apply it correctly and that helped me pass my tests.

## **What will you do next week?**

I do have an opportunity to try to get ahead on other clasess and create a schedule where I have a lot of free time. Obviously I want to use this free time on myself and I want to buy the Super Mario 3D All-Stars title. Despite my wants, I do feel like I should also study so I will set time aside so I can prepare for upcoming tests in late September and early October.

## **What was your experience of Collatz, the starter code, the makefile, its optimizations, and exceptions?**

I heard about Collatz Conjecture before from friends in other math or physics classes, but not to the extent that I know about it now. In that to look for other optimization techniques online, I found a lot of mathematic principles that could be used to optimizr Collatz. The starter code? I don't know what that means exactly, I was able to navigate it once I read the c++ files and see how they connected. The makefile was a document I knew I could run in the linux machine for past classes, but I didn't know much else about it. This past week I looked into learning more about the makefile and the elements that go into it and I did that reading the file made much more sense. So I'm very happy about that. 

## **What made you happy this week?**

Finishing the project, part of me thought I was going to to bomb the first project for the class but it worked out in the end. In general I didn't think this week was filled with enough mallice where anything made me happy because I was already happy to begin with. 

## **What's your tip-of-the-week?**

My tip of the week is to be help others, you never know when something trivial to you may be enormous for someone else. You don't have to feel good about yourself either when you help others, you can just feel good that they are better off.

# Blog 2: 09/06/2020

## **What did you do this past week?**

This week I forked the public repository to my private Gitlab and then I used `git clone` on the machines at the school to work on code from my local files. In terms of non-CS371P matters, I have just been taking notes and making sure I am staying ahead on all the other classes I am taking. I really enjoy this class I am taking on Comics, it's just cool to hear what other people have to say about topics they have a better understanding than I do. I have also been playing a few games to relieve myself and give my mind a rest.

## **What's in your way?**

Honestly, I have a lot trouble in getting started in projects involving makefiles and git. I overthink and miss a few details that can simplify my life. As far collatz concepts, it doesn't seem to be an issue so far, but I still need to test the code like the project intends for me to instead of me manually doing it myself.

## **What will you do next week?**

Next week I hope to finish Collatz before I have to type the next blog. Also, I intend to finish up other assignments due at the end of the month so I can focus on studying for upcoming tests. I also plan on signing up for recruiting events and hopefully something good happens.

## **What was your experience of assertions, Google Test, and gcov?**

My experience with these topics was zero, but the lectures were pretty insightful and it was easy to catch on. I really appreciated Professor Downing's teaching because it was simple and it got right to the point.

## **How are you doing and holding up? What's been most helpful for you in terms of support at this time?**

I am ok. Truthgull it is a bit difficult, but considering all the stories I've been hearing over the past months I have felt more grateful as of late. I think what's been helpful in times like these is counting the good things and knowing it could be a lot worse. That's just an idea for myself, I also don't want to invalidate the feelings of someone else if they do want to feel sad or negative of a situation.

## **What made you happy this week?**

Just having my dog makes me happy, she's very playful and she likes to be around a lot. I will say 2020 has more negative things going on and this period does not have the best signs for my generation.

## **What's your pick-of-the-week?**

My pick-of-the-week is HTML5 Boilerplate, this is tool for those interested or working as front end developers that sets up code templates of standard practices. HTML%Boilerplate also sets up javascript files to work with most browsers.

# Blog 1: 08/30/2020

This is the first blog I am writing as a student for CS371P in Professor Glenn Downing's class. I am excited to see what happens in the course and I hope for great things.

## **Where did you grow up?**

I grew up in Houston, Texas near downtown. To be more specific I spent most of my time in the northside of this city doing things in the Heights area and in Humble where Deerbrook is at. I love this city and all the people who reside in it. Although the driving here is scary because not many people use their blinkers, it's fun to explore (not sure if the lack of blinking is more common in the region, state, or even nation). Side note, growing up here I always thought that the size of Houston was very common. However, learned that was not the case and I have felt the difference living in Austin. Anyways, I grew up in Houston, Texas and it's a nice place to live in. 

## **What was your favorite extracurricular activity in high school?**

I would say it is band, but more specifically jazz band was fun. It had less to do with the music we played in the class but more about the times we spent going to festivals and other events where the school was asked to help out in. I think the size of the people in jazz band was a number where there was a lot of people, but it wasn't huge. So a lot of us interacted with each other a lot more. Plus, listening to other people at festivals was always a treat.

## **What are your expectations of this class?**

From what I heard from a lot past students it is all about C++ and learning about the language. At the same time I'm just going in thinking C++ will be used to show object-oriented concepts like Java was used in CS312 and CS314 to show common data structures in computer science.

## **What made you happy this week?**

Honestly, the fact that Hurricane Laura missed Houston and there was no heavy rain or winds this past Wednesday. It floods easily in Houston, I know storms have been getting worse in the past decades, but the construction in the city blocking a lot of the irrigation systems does not help. I know that the hurricane did go towards Louisiana and other towns in the boundry of Texas which is very sad and we keep them in our minds, but I do feel grateful for my friends and family.

## **Pick-of-the-Week**

I would say that I found out many companies are investing in electric delivery vans. They are mainly used for the environment and enrgy costs. But the trend of electric vans for delivery is allowing for companies to try and transition into smart cars and integrate their own system into vehicles instead of applications employees use on common devices.
