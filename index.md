## **What did you do this past week?**

This week I forked the public repository to my private Gitlab and then I used `git clone` on the machines at the school to work on code from my local files. In terms of non-CS371P matters, I have just been taking notes and making sure I am staying ahead on all the other classes I am taking. I really enjoy this class I am taking on Comics, it's just cool to hear what other people have to say about topics they have a better understanding than I do. I have also been playing a few games to relieve myself and give my mind a rest.

## **What's in your way?**

Honestly, I have a lot trouble in getting started in projects involving makefiles and git. I overthink and miss a few details that can simplify my life. As far collatz concepts, it doesn't seem to be an issue so far, but I still need to test the code like the project intends for me to instead of me manually doing it myself.

## **What will you do next week?**

Next week I hope to finish Collatz before I have to type the next blog. Also, I intend to finish up other assignments due at the end of the month so I can focus on studying for upcoming tests. I also plan on signing up for recruiting events and hopefully something good happens.

## **What was your experience of assertions, Google Test, and gcov?**

My experience with these topics was zero, but the lectures were pretty insightful and it was easy to catch on. I really appreciated Professor Downing's teaching because it was simple and it got right to the point.

## **How are you doing and holding up? What's been most helpful for you in terms of support at this time?**

I am ok. Truthgull it is a bit difficult, but considering all the stories I've been hearing over the past months I have felt more grateful as of late. I think what's been helpful in times like these is counting the good things and knowing it could be a lot worse. That's just an idea for myself, I also don't want to invalidate the feelings of someone else if they do want to feel sad or negative of a situation.

## **What made you happy this week?**

Just having my dog makes me happy, she's very playful and she likes to be around a lot. I will say 2020 has more negative things going on and this period does not have the best signs for my generation.

## **What's your pick-of-the-week?**

My pick-of-the-week is HTML5 Boilerplate, this is tool for those interested or working as front end developers that sets up code templates of standard practices. HTML%Boilerplate also sets up javascript files to work with most browsers.

# Blog 1: 08/30/2020

This is the first blog I am writing as a student for CS371P in Professor Glenn Downing's class. I am excited to see what happens in the course and I hope for great things.

## **Where did you grow up?**

I grew up in Houston, Texas near downtown. To be more specific I spent most of my time in the northside of this city doing things in the Heights area and in Humble where Deerbrook is at. I love this city and all the people who reside in it. Although the driving here is scary because not many people use their blinkers, it's fun to explore (not sure if the lack of blinking is more common in the region, state, or even nation). Side note, growing up here I always thought that the size of Houston was very common. However, learned that was not the case and I have felt the difference living in Austin. Anyways, I grew up in Houston, Texas and it's a nice place to live in. 

## **What was your favorite extracurricular activity in high school?**

I would say it is band, but more specifically jazz band was fun. It had less to do with the music we played in the class but more about the times we spent going to festivals and other events where the school was asked to help out in. I think the size of the people in jazz band was a number where there was a lot of people, but it wasn't huge. So a lot of us interacted with each other a lot more. Plus, listening to other people at festivals was always a treat.

## **What are your expectations of this class?**

From what I heard from a lot past students it is all about C++ and learning about the language. At the same time I'm just going in thinking C++ will be used to show object-oriented concepts like Java was used in CS312 and CS314 to show common data structures in computer science.

## **What made you happy this week?**

Honestly, the fact that Hurricane Laura missed Houston and there was no heavy rain or winds this past Wednesday. It floods easily in Houston, I know storms have been getting worse in the past decades, but the construction in the city blocking a lot of the irrigation systems does not help. I know that the hurricane did go towards Louisiana and other towns in the boundry of Texas which is very sad and we keep them in our minds, but I do feel grateful for my friends and family.

## **Pick-of-the-Week**

I would say that I found out many companies are investing in electric delivery vans. They are mainly used for the environment and enrgy costs. But the trend of electric vans for delivery is allowing for companies to try and transition into smart cars and integrate their own system into vehicles instead of applications employees use on common devices.
